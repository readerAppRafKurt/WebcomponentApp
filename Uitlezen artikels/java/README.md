## Exporting Resources from Eclipse 

	1.Go to File -> Export. The following dialog will appear.
	2.The easiest way to share projects with the rest of the world is through compressing the project files into an archive file, a process which Eclipse performs automatically. Select Archive File in the list presented in the figure above and click Next. 
	3.Click the checkbox next to the project you would like to export.
	4.Then, you'll want to click Browse and choose a location and name for the archive file (this is equivalent to "Save As..." in many applications).
	5.Click Finish. Eclipse will automatically export and zip your project into an archive file and store it in the location you specified.


##To import the entire Eclipse project from an archive file, follow these steps. 
	
	1.Go to File -> Import. The following dialog will appear.
	2.Select Existing Projects into Workspace.
		NOTE: It may seem counter-intuitive to not be selecting Archive File at this step. The Archive File option is used for importing Eclipse resources into an existing Eclipse project. Since you are importing an entire project, you must select Existing projects.
	3.Click the radio button next to Select archive file and click the Browse button on the following dialog.
	4.Find the archive file on your hard disk. Click Open to select it.
	5.If you have selected an archive file containing an entire Eclipse project, the project name will appear in the box below, already checked. Click Finish to perform the import.
